## Modelling interaction effects

You'll continue to work with the data on opposition party behaviour in European national parliaments by Tuttnauer (2018). This week, you are asked to reproduce some of the results from the paper with a focus on modelling and interpreting interaction effects. 

Please start by reproducing model 6 (page 290) in Tuttnauer (2018). The dependent variable is, as in previous weeks, `conflict_p`. The model includes an interaction of `seatshare` and government experience, (`ge`) as the key explanatory terms. Moreover, the model should control for 

- `abs_lrdiff`: Ideological distance from the government as the absolute difference between a party's left-right position and the size-weighted average position of the government coalition
- `govside`: A dummy for whether (= 1) or not (= 0) the opposition is on the ideological side of the government
- `inst_power`: Institutional power of the opposition measuring the strength of the committee system on a scale from 0 to 7
- `y_openness`: Average number of distinct government compositions in the past 10 years
- `importance`: Index ranging between 0 (= low-importance parliament) and 1 (= high-importance parliament)
- `govrange`: Ideological range of the government coalition
- `govtype_mod`: A dummy (= 1) for surplus coalitions, in contrast with minimal-winning ones (= 0)
- `record_threshold`: The percentage of MPs needed to call for a recorded vote
- `frequency`: Frequency of recorded votes

**Please specify and run model 6 from Tuttnauer (2018) and report the coefficients for the constitutive term of party size as well as the interaction term of party size and government experience. Round to two digits after the decimal.**

```{r lm_1_sol, eval=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
model <- lm(conflict_p ~ seatshare*ge + abs_lrdiff + govside + inst_power + 
              y_openness + importance + govrange + govtype_mod + 
              record_threshold + frequency,
            data = opposition)

model %>% tidy() %>% filter(term == "seatshare" | term == "seatshare:ge")
```

```{r lm_1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r lm_1_q, echo = FALSE}
question_text("Enter the value of coefficient of the constitutive term of seat share:",
  answer("1.92", correct = T),
  allow_retry = T, 
  incorrect = "Hint: Revisit the code from the lab session. Make sure that you included all variables in the model."
)
```

```{r lm_2_q, echo = FALSE}
question_text("Enter the value of the coefficient of the interaction term of seat share and ge:",
  answer("-3.21", correct = T),
  allow_retry = T, 
  incorrect = "Hint: Revisit the code from the lab session. Make sure that you included all variables in the model."
)
```


## Interpreting interaction effects

Interpreting interaction effects can be tricky. As discussed in class, there are two main approaches: We can look at the marginal effect of a variable conditional on values of the moderating variable (as Tuttnauer did in Figure 2 in his paper) or we can calculate predicted values to generate meaningful quantities of interest. In this learnr tutorial, we focus on calculating predicted values.


### Predicted values

**What is the predicted (expected) average opposition share (in percent) when party size is at its minimum in comparison to when party size is at its maximum if government experience is equal to one, holding everything else at the respective mean/median. Please also calculate the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. When submitting your results, please round them to two integer digits (e.g., 0.23, 4.5, 13, 60, 65)**

*Hint: The `predict()` function may be very useful for this exercise. Recall that govtype_mod and govside are binary variables when you specify a scenario of interest.*

*You can re-run the regression model in the chunk below. Alternatively, the correct regression output is already stored in an object called `out_ia`.*

```{r predict_sol, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
model <- lm(conflict_p ~ abs_lrdiff + seatshare*ge + govside + inst_power + 
              y_openness + importance + govrange + govtype_mod + 
              record_threshold + frequency,
            data = opposition)

df_scenario <- tibble(
   seatshare = c(min(opposition$seatshare), max(opposition$seatshare)), 
   ge = 1,
   abs_lrdiff = mean(opposition$abs_lrdiff),
   govrange = mean(opposition$govrange),
   govside = median(opposition$govside),
   inst_power = mean(opposition$inst_power),
   y_openness = mean(opposition$y_openness),
   importance = mean(opposition$importance),
   govtype_mod = median(opposition$govtype_mod),
   record_threshold = mean(opposition$record_threshold),
   frequency = mean(opposition$frequency)
)

round(predict(model, newdata = df_scenario, interval = "confidence") * 100, 0)

# manually
predict(model, newdata = df_scenario, se.fit = T) %>% as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(
    fit = fit * 100,
    se.fit = se.fit * 100,
    lower = fit - 1.96 * se.fit,
    upper = fit + 1.96 * se.fit)

```

```{r predict-setup}
out_ia <- lm(conflict_p ~ seatshare*ge + abs_lrdiff + govside + inst_power + 
                  y_openness + importance + govrange + govtype_mod + record_threshold + frequency,
                data = opposition)
```

```{r predict, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "lm_1"}

```

```{r predict_min, echo = FALSE}
question_text("Enter the value of the predicted average opposition share (in percent) when government experience is equal to one and party size is at its minimum (rounded to two integer digits):",
  answer("67", correct = T),
  answer("67.42", correct = F, message = "Please round your results to two integer digits."),
  answer("67.4", correct = F, message = "Please round your results to two integer digits."),
  allow_retry = T, incorrect = "Hint: Revisit the code from the lab session, in particular, the predict() function. Have you set all binary variables to their median (and not the mean)?"
)
```

```{r predict_max, echo = FALSE}
question_text("Enter the value of the predicted average opposition share (in percent)  when government experience is equal to one and party size is at its maximum (rounded to two integer digits):",
  answer("15", correct = T),
  answer("15.27", correct = F, message = "Please round your results to two integer digits."),
  answer("15.3", correct = F, message = "Please round your results to two integer digits."),
  allow_retry = T, incorrect = "Hint: Revisit the code from the lab session, in particular, the predict() function."
)
```

```{r predict_low, echo = FALSE}
question_text("Enter the value of the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (in percent) when government experience is equal to one and party size is at its minimum (rounded to two integer digits):",
  answer("41", correct = T),
  answer("42", correct = T),
  allow_retry = T, incorrect = "Hint: Revisit the code from the lab session, in particular, the predict() function."
)
```

```{r predict_high, echo = FALSE}
question_text("Enter the value of the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (in percent) when government experience is equal to one and party size is at its maximum (rounded to two integer digits):",
  answer("55", correct = T),
  answer("54", correct = T),
  allow_retry = T, incorrect = "Hint: Revisit the code from the lab session, in particular, the predict() function."
)
```

**So what do we learn from the predictions?**

```{r predict_interpret, echo = FALSE}
question("The predicted average value for votes against the government...",
  answer("is unlikely to differ for opposition parties with maximum government experience conditional on their party size.", 
         correct = T, 
         message = "Due to the overlap of the confidence intervals, we have good reason to not exclude the possibility that there may be no difference in the expected value in the two specified scenarios. However, note that this is not an explicit statistical test whether there is a difference, but only a first (strong) indication."),
  answer("is likely to differ for opposition parties with maximum government experience conditional on their party size.", 
         correct = F,
         message = "Have a closer look at the confidence intervals. What do you find?"),
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = T
)
```
